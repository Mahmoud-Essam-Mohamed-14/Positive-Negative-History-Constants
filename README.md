# Positive-Negative-History-Constants
This is Data Analysis With Python Project that includes more than 100 entities which every one has 263 record.

The Project requires the following stages:

1- Identify the current mode if "+" or "-" based on the last two records
2-  Calculate negative history and positive history constants for all entities based on their average history sequence
3- Calculate decline count for all entities that have "-" current mode based on the last "-" steps
4- Plot line graph for the entities that have a decline count > negative history constant
